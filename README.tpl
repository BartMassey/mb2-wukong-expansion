# {{crate}}: Rust for the Elecfreaks Wukong Expansion Board for the BBC micro:bit v2
Copyright Â© 2024 Bart Massey (Version {{version}})

# Acknowledgments

Thanks to Elecfreaks for doing this board, and to the folks
who wrote the Micropython and PTX Javascript that I cribbed
the I2C protocol from.

# Spelling

Is it "WuKong" or "Wukong"? Elecfreaks seems to randomly
switch between the two capitalizations in their products, so
I won't worry about it much: I haven't been consistent
either.
